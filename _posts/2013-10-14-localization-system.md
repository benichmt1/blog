## android2po

Convert Android string resources to gettext .po files, and import them right back.

The goal is to remove as many syntax elements required by the Android string resource files when exporting, to present the text to translators in as easy a format as possible; and correctly writing everything back to Android on import while keeping the generated XML files easily readable as well (i.e. no unnecessary escaping).
